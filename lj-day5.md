Class to me is like being on a rollercoaster.. I get somethings and just dont get other things.. Rachel is doing an awesome job teaching though, today's lecture was super helpful and I decided not to follow along on my own and watch her and I think I actually end up understanding a little better. We'll see when we actually start our next project. I'm really looking forward to our group project.
